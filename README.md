### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/streamx.git
cd streamx
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
This command installs all necessary packages for both the frontend and backend.

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store all your secret keys and credentials.

#### `.env` file Template

```env
# Google OAuth Client ID (from Google Cloud Console)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# MongoDB Connection String (from MongoDB Atlas)
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret Key (generate a strong, 64-character random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_jwt_secret

# Nodemailer/Gmail Credentials
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_google_app_password
```

**4. Configure Google OAuth Credentials:**

  * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
  * Create or select a project.
  * Navigate to "Credentials", click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS", and select "OAuth client ID".
  * Choose "Web application" as the type.
  * Under **"Authorised JavaScript origins"**, add your frontend's development URL: `http://localhost:5173`.
  * Copy the generated **Client ID** and paste it into the `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` field in your `.env` file.

**5. Run the application:**
This command uses `concurrently` to launch both the backend Express server and the frontend Vite development server simultaneously.

```bash
npm run dev
```

  * Your React application will be available at **`http://localhost:5173`**.
  * Your Node.js backend API will be running on **`http://localhost:3000`**.
